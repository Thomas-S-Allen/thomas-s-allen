# Biography

I am a data scientist, astronomer and educator.  My astronomy research interests include young stars, their properties, their environments and their dusty planet forming material. My primary focus has been on observational studies of groups of young stars that range in size from bound systems of two stars to loose associations containing thousands of stars. To conduct these observations, I use a variety of ground and space-based telescopes and also include archival and literature data sources. By combining observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum, I am able to determine the physical properties of these young stars and associated material to better understand the processes that shape star, and by extension, planet formation.
