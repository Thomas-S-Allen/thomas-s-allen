# Biography

I am a data scientist, astronomer and educator.  As an astronomer, my research interests include observational studies of young stars, their properties, environments and dusty planet forming material.  To do this, I have used a variety of ground and space-based telescopes to study groups of young stars that range in size from bound systems of two stars to loose associations containing thousands of stars.   As an educator, I am interested in hands on science instruction with a focus on active learning methods in physics and astronomy.  I have taught in both formal and informal educztional settings, with learners of all ages.  As a data scientist, I am interested in the process of analysis as much as the results.
